# Nonlinear fitting kinetics DNA and RNAP
Nonlinear regression using to estimate kinetics constants of DNA promoter opening and escape during transcription initiation complex assembled between Lambda PR promoter and E. coli RNA polymerase. Based on [Kinetics of promoter escape by bacterial RNA polymerase: effects of
promoter contacts and transcription bubble collapse](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263709791_Kinetics_of_promoter_escape_by_bacterial_RNA_polymerase_Effects_of_promoter_contacts_and_transcription_bubble_collapse).

under developing!

## Requirements
```
numpy =1.16.2
scipy = 1.2.1
matplotlib = 1.5.1
```
## Approach
**What is a simple method to fit and estimate constants of that exponential function?**
